# Overview 
We are observing varying temeratures in Oahu before opening and operating a surf and ice cream shop in that specific island of Hawaii.
In this case, we look at descriptive statistics of temeperatures generated in the months of June and December in Oahu. 

# Results 
Before opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, we need to find out if will generate profit in the long run. One factor that determines the duration of the company is the temeratures generated in Oahu. We have observed very descriptive statistics for temperatures made in the months of June and December. The tools to conduct this analysis are Python, Pandas, and SqLite. We used SqLite to extract the temperature data from a sql file called "hawaii.sqlite." We then used Jupyter notebook to generate the descriptive statistics for temeperatures generated in the months of June and December. The file to generate the descriptive statistics is called "SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb."

Here are the descriptive temperatures for the month of June.

# Summary 
As we can see, the temeratures in June and December seems to be at satisfactory temperatures to open a surf and ice cream shop. However, this is not enough information provided in order to be sure if the store will remain open in the long run. The other factor to consider is the percipitation. This is the other piece of information provided in the aforementioned SqLite file. By using the file, "SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb," we can generate descriptive statistics in regards to the percipitation in Oahu. 

Here is the descriptive statistics for percipitation generated in the month of June.
